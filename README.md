# Account Service

This project was created as some use cases (CRUD and Transfer Money) sample for hexagonal architecture.

Here, you can reach my Medium article about [Hexagonal (Ports & Adapter) Architecture.](https://medium.com/@TKonuklar/hexagonal-ports-adapters-architecture-e3617bcf00a0)

This project provides endpoints for account domain CRUD actions and to transfer money from one account to another.

The Account service provides data like below:

Account:
* id
* Account id

* Account Owner
* Account Balance
* Creation Time

Transfer:
* Sender Account Id
* Receiver Account Id
* Amount
* Result
* Timestamp
